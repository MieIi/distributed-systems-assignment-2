README:

The docker image for the program can be built by using the command "docker build ." in the root of this folder.
Simply running the container will run the program and no user inputs are needed.

The program serialization.py will create a dictionary containing key strings and integer values that it serialises to various formats and saves the serialized data to files. 
The program will print out the time taken to serialize, the size of the serialized data, and the time taken to deserialize the data, into the terminal.
